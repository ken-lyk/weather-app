    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash

    ```

3.  **Configure API Key:**

    *   Sign up for an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/). (or a similar weather API).
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project (if you don't have one already).
    *   Add your API key to the `.env` file:

        ```
        REACT_APP_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
